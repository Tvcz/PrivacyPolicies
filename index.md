## Auto Calendar for NEU Banner

- The data collected from NEU Banner (which is the only site from which any data is collected) while using the extension is not saved and is only transmitted to Google Calendar services.

- The data collected consists only of class information such as course name, location, time, and instructors. Again, none of this is saved anywhere but to your calendar.

- The only way your Google authentication is used is to create a new calendar and place events on it. No part of your existing calendar is read or edited.

- All of this can be confirmed by looking at the source code at GitHub: https://github.com/Tvcz/AutoCalendarForNEUBanner

## 2048: Rewritten

- This app collects no data whatsoever. The game runs locally and no data about the users is transmitted by the app.

- Google AdSense may collect and transmit user data, dependent on their policies.

- All of this can be confirmed by looking at the source code at GitHub: https://github.com/tvcz/2048
